This was created to demonstrate learnings from the Code Institute software development course and marks the third of four milestone projects to be created. It utilises HTML, CSS,Javascript, Pymongo, Jinja 2, MongoDB and UX by way of an interactive website that can store user data to the back end.

## User Experience (UX)
### User stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time Visitor, I want 
* As a First Time Visitor, I want  
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be redirected to the landing page if I navigate to a wrong or broken link.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning Visitor, I want 
* As a Returning Visitor, I want 
#### Frequent User Goals
* As a Frequent User, I want to access the site across a range of devices.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The site uses the following 6 colours primarily.   
![image](mdassets/mdimages/colors.png)

* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

In places it uses an alternate Green - rgb(3,160,98) #03A062
#### Typography
* [The Roboto font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) is used on all elements throughout the site with monospace as a fall back in case of errors in loading the font. Roboto is a clean and stylish popular choice as Androids default font and so fits the target market of those that are more ‘tech’ orientated and gives a modern CLI esque take on the font. 
* [VT323](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323) is used as an additional theme choice on the CV page and is a fitting nod to many an old school game. 
#### Imagery
The site uses . .  
#### Wireframes
